# May I introduce you to Captain RAYmond Holt?

Captain RAYmond Holt is a renderer me and my fellow student Julian programmed in Cpp for the university course Computer Graphics at Saarland University. The students were provided with a framework from the chair to implement the renderer. Our renderer can handle a perspective camera model, basic primitive intersections like meshes, spheres and rectangles, as well as materials like metal, glass, frosted glass and glossy and diffuse surfaces. We also implemented a denoising library, area lights, point lights and directional lights, as well as environment mapping.
